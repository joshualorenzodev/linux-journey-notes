# Getting Started

## History

- Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie developed UNIX OS
- Richard Stallman started working on the GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project
- The `Kernel` is the most important piece in the OS. Allows the hardware to talk to the software.
- `Linus Torvalds` developed the Linux kernel we know today

## Choosing a Linux Distribution

A Linux system is divided into three main parts:

- `Hardware` - CPU, memory, disks, etc.
- `Linux Kernel` - manages the hardware and tells it how to interact with the system
- `User Space` - where users can directly interact with the system

## Debian
